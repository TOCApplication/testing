                r = 0     where Σ = {0}<br>

              <h2>Q.4 State pumping lemma and its advantages.</h2>
              <p class="answer">Pumping lemma: Let L be a regular set. Then there exists a constant n such that if z is any word in L such that |z| ≥ n then we can write z = uvw such that |uv|&lt;n and |v| ≥ 1 for all i ≥ 0 and uv<sup>i</sup>w is in L. The n indicates number of states in FA and should not be greater than the number of states. <br>


                The advantage of pumping lemma is that this theorem is used to check whether given language is regular or not.</p>

              <h2>Q.5 Show that the complement of a regular language is also regular</h2>
              <p class="answer"> If L is a regular language, then its complement denoted by L' is also regular. To prove this, consider that language L is accepted by finite automaton M. Now all the words accepted by language L will reach to final state of machine M. If we change all the states of M to non-final states and all the non-final states of M to final state we get a new FA which is denoted by M'. Now this M' will accept all the words not belonging to L and reject all the words belonging to L. That means M' will accept the language L'. Thus there exists FA which accepts L'. Hence L' which is complement of L is also regular.</p>

              <p class="answer">The {10+ 11}* is a set containing the strings of any combination of 10 and 11. This set also contains & or null string.<br>

                The items of this set are<br>
                
                {ε, 10, 11, 1010, 1011, 1111, 1110, 111111, 101010, ...}</p>

              <h2>Q.7 Is the set of strings over the alphabet {0} of the form 0n where n is not a prime is regular ? Prove or disprove.</h2>
              <p class="answer">Let us assume that L is a regular language n is not a prime number. <br>

                Let zϵL, L = 0n <br>
                
                |z| = uvw,     here i = 1. <br>
                
                Now consider L = uv<sup>i</sup>w     where i = 2 <br>
                
                = u v. vw <br>
                
                That means adding 1 to n, we get <br>
                
                n &lt; |uvvw| <br>
                
                n &lt; n+1 <br>
                
                But (n + 1) can be a prime number. Hence our assumption becomes contradictory to it. This shows that L is not regular language.</p>

              <h2>Q.11 Mention the applications of pumping lemma.</h2>
              <p class="answer">1. Pumping lemma is used for deciding whether or not the given language is regular.  <br>

                2. It is also useful for determing whether L is accepted by a regular expression or not. <br>
                
                Example 1: <br>
                
                L = {0n1n} is not regular. <br>
                
                L = {0P|p-is a prime number} <br>
                
                Example 2: <br>
                
                All these languages are non-regular languages and this can be proved by pumping lemma.</p>

              <h2>Q.12 Is it true that the language accepted by NFA is different from regular language? Justify your answer.</h2>
              <p class="answer">The language accepted by NFA is always regular. Because any NFA is equivalent to DFA. And if we represent certain language by NFA then we can definitely represent it using DFA. The regular language is a kind of language which can be represented by DFA. Hence the language accepted by NFA is not different from regular language.</p>

            <h2>Q.20 Compare FM, PDA and TM </h2>
            <p class="answer"> Finite Machine is of two types - DFA and NFA. Both DFA and NFA accept regular language only <br>
              PDA has a memory and hence it accepts large class of language. <br>
              TM can be programmed. Hence TM accepts very large class of language. TM is therfore most powerful computational mode

            <p class="answer">        Yes, TMs simulate computer of functions from integers to integers. That means it is a device for computing integer valued functions. In this scheme integers were presented in unary as blocks of a single character and machine computed by changing the lengths of blocks or by constructing new blocks on the input tape </p>

            <h2>Q.23 Define Subroutines in Turing machine </h2>
            <p class="answer">A Turing machine subroutine is a set of states that performs some useful process. This set of states includes a start state and another state that temporarily has no moves, and that serves at the return state to pass control to whatever other set of states called the subroutine </p>

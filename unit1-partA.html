                <h2>Q.6 What is induction principle? Give an example. </h2>
                <p class="answer">The proof by mathematical induction can be carried out using following steps – <br>


                  1. Basis: In this step we assume the lowest possible value. This is an initial step in the proof of mathematical induction.<br>
                  
                  For example, we can prove that the result is true for n = 0 or n = 1.<br>
                  
                  2. Induction Hypothesis: In this step we assign value of n to some other value k. That mean we will check whether the result is true for n = k or not.<br>
                  
                  3. Inductive Step: In this step, if n = k is true then we check whether the result is true for n k+ 1 or not. If we get the same result at n = k + 1 then we can state that given proof is true by principle of mathematical induction..</p>

                <p class="answer">In proof by contradiction technique, for the statement of the form if A then B we start with statement A is not true and thus by assuming this false A we try to get the conclusion of statement B. When it becomes impossible to reach to statement B, then we contradict ourselves and accept that A is true.</p>

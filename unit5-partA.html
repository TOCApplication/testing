              Again reduce L<sub>u</sub> to the modified PCP.

            <h2>Q.5 Show that any PSPACE-hard language is also NP-hard.</h2>
            <p class="answer">First we must show that the language is not in NP. This is trivial since NP is a subset of PSPACE and therefore, anything outside of PSPACE is also outside of NP.<br>
              Then we must show that any problem in NP can be reduced to any PSPACE-hard language. Thus, any PSPACE-hard problem is also NP-hard.

            <p class="answer">L1 and L2 are recusive language. Then there exists a machine M1 that accepts L1 as well as machine M2 that accepts L2. We can simulate a machine M that accepts the language L such that L = L1 U L2. Then construct M which accepts if M1 accepts. If M1 does not accept then M2 simulates M. That means if M2 accepts then M accepts, if M2 rejects M also rejects. Thus M accepts the language L = L1 U L2 which is recursive.</p>
